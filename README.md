🏠 AR-FloorPlan-Prototype
2D Floor Plan → 3D AR Visualization (Web-Based Architecture Tool)

AR-FloorPlan-Prototype is a web-based system that converts 2D architectural floor plans into interactive 3D models and visualizes them in Augmented Reality (WebXR).
Built using Computer Vision + 3D Graphics + AR, this project demonstrates strong technical proficiency across OpenCV.js, Three.js, WebGL, and WebXR.

This project is designed to help architects, designers, and clients better understand spatial layouts by experiencing them at real-world scale.

⭐ Why This Project Matters 

Demonstrates end-to-end problem solving using CV + 3D + AR.

Fully browser-based, no app installation required.

Showcases skills in image processing, mesh generation, AR rendering, and modern JavaScript workflows.

Real-world use case for architecture, real estate, interior design, and educational demos.
